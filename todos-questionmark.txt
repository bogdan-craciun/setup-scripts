To activate the syntax highlighting, add the following at the end of your .zshrc:
source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh

If you receive "highlighters directory not found" error message,
you may need to add the following to your .zshenv:
export ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS_DIR=/opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/highlighters
==> Summary
🍺 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/zsh-syntax-highlighting/0.7.1: 27 files, 164.7KB
==> Running `brew cleanup zsh-syntax-highlighting`...
Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).

To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:

if type brew &>/dev/null; then
FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit

fi

You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
to load these completions, you may need to run these commands:

chmod go-w '/opt/homebrew/share'
chmod -R go-w '/opt/homebrew/share/zsh'
